Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, designed for use with Node.js. It provides a higher-level, schema-based solution for interacting with MongoDB databases, simplifying data modeling and validation within JavaScript applications.

Key features and functionalities of Mongoose:
Schema Definition:
Mongoose allows developers to define schemas that enforce a specific structure and data types for documents within a MongoDB collection. This helps in maintaining data integrity and consistency.
Data Validation:
It includes built-in validation features to ensure that data conforms to the defined schema before being saved to the database.
Query Building:
Mongoose provides a robust and chainable API for constructing and executing queries, making it easier to retrieve, update, and delete data.
Middleware and Hooks:
It offers various hooks and middleware functions that allow developers to execute custom logic at different stages of the data lifecycle (e.g., before saving a document, after finding documents).
Relationship Management:
Mongoose facilitates the modeling of relationships between different data entities, providing mechanisms for referencing documents across collections.
Type Casting:
It handles automatic type casting, converting data between JavaScript types and MongoDB BSON types.
